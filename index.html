        <h2>Optimizing Data for Business Insights</h2>
        <p>One of the most time consuming steps in any data analysis is cleaning the data and getting it into a format that allows analysis. Data wrangling is the process of converting and/or mapping data from one form into a format that allows for more convenient use in analytics. We organize disparate data sets collected by multiple parties, including conversion of PDF files to machine readable formats and data scraping.</p>

        <h2>Visual Stories that Drive Insight</h2>
        <p>One of the best ways to get your message across is to use a visualization to quickly draw attention to the key messages. By presenting data visually it's possible to uncover surprising patterns and observations that wouldn't be apparent from looking at statistics alone. Our team creates interactive stories, tools, and products that are driven by your data and crafted to your delight.</p>
